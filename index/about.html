    <h2><b>What is FOSS</b></h2>
	<p>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is a type of software that ensures users have the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the software. Unlike proprietary software,   which restricts these freedoms, FOSS promotes collaboration and sharing, fostering a community-driven approach to software development.</p>
	<h2><b>FOSS LBSITW</b></h2>

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, our club offers a welcoming environment to learn, share, and grow.</p>
