        <h2>About</h2><br>
        <h4>The FOSS Club</h4><br>
        <br>
        <p>The FOSS Club at LBSITW is a dynamic student organization dedicated to the promotion and adoption of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) within the campus community. Our mission is to foster a culture of collaboration, innovation, and knowledge-sharing among students, empowering them with the skills and mindset necessary to contribute to the global open-source ecosystem. We believe that FOSS is not just about free software, but also about freedomâ€”freedom to learn, modify, and share software without restrictions.Our club organizes a variety of activities, including workshops, hackathons, coding competitions, and guest lectures by industry experts. These events provide students with hands-on experience and exposure to cutting-edge technologies. We cover a wide range of topics such as Linux, version control systems like Git, programming languages, web development frameworks, and more. By participating in these activities, members can enhance their technical skills, build impressive portfolios, and network with professionals and peers who share their passion for open-source.
            <br>
            One of the key initiatives of our club is the mentorship program, where senior members guide juniors through their learning journey, helping them to understand the fundamentals of open-source contributions. We also collaborate with other tech clubs and organizations to host joint events and expand our reach. Our club members actively participate in global open-source programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and contribute to renowned projects, gaining recognition and experience.

        The FOSS Club at LBSITW is not just about coding; it's about creating a community of like-minded individuals who believe in the power of open-source to drive technological advancement and societal progress. We encourage creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, preparing our members for successful careers in the tech industry. Through our efforts, we aim to make a significant impact on both the local and global open-source communities
